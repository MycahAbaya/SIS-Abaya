# 1. Find an actual dataset from the web for each of the following types of data:
a. *STRUCTURED* - Poverty Incidence among Families and Population in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao: 2015, 2018, and 2021
b. *SEMI-STRUCTURED* - Tbilisi Housing Challenge 2020
c. *UNSTRUCTURED* - U.S Teens Have a Mix of Emotions About Climate Change

# 2. Write an R Markdown document containing three sections corresponding to each of the types of data above detailing the following:

**STRUCTURED**
a. Use this code to read the (csv) dataset. Using the following package: readxl.

```{r}
library(readxl)

# loading dataset
poverty <- read_xlsx("C:/Users/PC_user/Downloads/stt1571-2023-activities-abaya-mycahtherese/poverty.xlsx")

# values
poverty <- data.frame(
  Region = c("PHILIPPINES", "Luzon", "NCR", "Rest of Luzon", "Visayas", "Mindanao"),
  Family_Poverty_2015 = c(18.0, 10.9, 2.8, 13.3, 24.2, 30.9),
  Family_Poverty_2018 = c(12.1, 6.6, 1.4, 8.1, 15.2, 23.8),
  Family_Poverty_2021p = c(13.2, 8.5, 2.2, 10.4, 18.9, 20.5),
  Population_Poverty_2015 = c(23.5, 14.8, 4.1, 17.9, 30.2, 38.7),
  Population_Poverty_2018 = c(16.7, 9.3, 2.2, 11.4, 20.2, 31.6),
  Population_Poverty_2021p = c(18.1, 12.0, 3.5, 14.5, 24.6, 27.7)
)
poverty
```
**b. To import the XLSX dataset, it's necessary to define the object to hold the data. Rename the dataset to "poverty" and load the file by specifying its file directory. Here's the step-by-step process:**

*Define Object:*
Begin by defining the object to store the imported data. For this example, let's name the object "poverty".

*Load the Dataset:*
Use the read_xlsx() function from the readxl package to load the XLSX file. Provide the complete file directory where the XLSX file is located. Assign the loaded data to the "poverty" object.

The code above generates a tabulated r output of the xlsx file. As shown, the regions: PHILIPPINES, Luzon, NCR, Rest of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are the variables located at the first column of the table. Following the values for poverty incidence among families and population for the years: 2015, 2018, and 2021. 

**c. Issues encountered while reading the dataset.**
While reading and importing the xlsx dataset, we encountered problems while generating the R output. Since there are empty cells in the xslx file, it affects the R output resulting to a disorganized table. Hence, in order to solve this problem, we have to modify the file and remove empty cells. Moreover, to generate organized table, we use "data.frame" and manually put the individual values to each column and rows. 

**SEMI-STRUCTURED**

For the unstructured dataset, we will be using JSON file as an example. The dataset is entitled "Tbilisi Housing Challenge 2020" which predicts the prices of housing using data from the year 2020.

**a. Use this code to read the (JSON) dataset. Using the following package: jsonlite**

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
```

```{r}
house_data <- fromJSON("C:/Users/PC_user/Downloads/stt1571-2023-activities-abaya-mycahtherese/house.json")
house <- as.data.frame(house_data)
house
```

**b. To import the json dataset, we'll do the same as the xlsx dataset. Rename the dataset to "house" and load the file by specifying its file directory. Here's the step-by-step process:**

*Define Object:*
Define the object to store the imported data. For this example, let's name the object "house".

*Load the Dataset:*
Use the fromJSON function from the jsonlite package to load the JSON file. Provide the complete file directory where the JSON file is located. Assign the loaded data to the "house" object.

After running the r chunk, a tabulated r output is generated. It shows the 10 rows out of 10,000 rows (or houses). Columns consists of: Address, product_tree, time, views, title, id, price_gel, price_usd, space, room, bedroom, floor, and description. 

Further description of columns:

address: address of the house
product_tree: summary of the house
time: exact timestamp of when the house is listed
views: # of persons who visited the house profile
title: can be 'new', 'old' or 'construction'. latter means apartment is not finished
id: house id #
price_gel: Price of house in GEL
prie_usd: Price of house in USD
space: total area of house in m^2
room: # of rooms
bedroom: # of bedrooms
floor: what floor is the house at
description: further description of the house owner
amenities: inclusions of buying the house
latitude & longitude: geo coordinates
poster type: posted by the owner or an agent
poster id: account  id used by the poster


**c. Issues encountered while reading the dataset.**
There are no issues while reading and importing the JSON dataset.

**UNSTRUCTURED**

For the unstructured dataset, we will be using an image as an example. The image is entitled "U.S Teens Have a Mix of Emotions About Climate Change". Many young people report feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of dealing with the current and future repercussions of climate change. The Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation found that 57 percent of U.S. teens are afraid of climate change. Nearly the same share of teens feels motivated by climate change. Only one in five teens reported being uninterested in climate change, (Feldman, 2019).

**a. Use this code to read the (image) data. Use the following package: "knitr".**

```{r}
library(knitr)
knitr:: include_graphics("C:/Users/PC_user/Downloads/stt1571-2023-activities-abaya-mycahtherese/climate_change.jpg")
```

**b. To import the image, we'll be using the "include_graphics" function in the knitr package. Then, load the file by specifying its file directory.**

The generated R output shows the graph of U.S teens having mix emotions about climate change. The data showcases different sentiments: 57% express fear, 54% are motivated, 52% report anger, 43% feel helpless, 42% experience guilt, 29% is optimistic, while 20% is uninterested.

**c. Issues encountered while reading the dataset.**
There are no issues while reading and importing the image. 

# 3. For the structured data in item (1a), do the following:

**a. Write the data in tabular with one column per variable and one row per observation or cases.**

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
knitr:: kable(poverty) %>% kable_styling()
```

**b. Discuss the levels/scales of measurements where each of the (column) variables belong to:**
Poverty Incidence among Families - RATIO
Poverty Incidence among Population - RATIO

**c. Justify or explain your answer in 3b.**
Since the values are represented using percentage (%), then we can assume that the level of measurement in this dataset is RATIO. The data has all the properties of interval measurement, and it also has a true zero point, which in this case is 0%, representing the complete absence of poverty.
